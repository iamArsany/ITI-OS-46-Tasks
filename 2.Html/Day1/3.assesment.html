     My dog sasha is my best friend and
      she likes to chase the soccer ball when i practice
      . It is so funny to see her running down the field 
      trying to catch the ball with her mouth.
      It just won't fit!

      <br>
      <pr>once sasha saved my life. when i was only 4 years old.
      I started to go into the street to get a ball that had roll
      across the street. Of course Idid not think to look for cars!
      sasha got in front of me and knocked me backwards onto the sidewalk I was mad until i saw the car go by
      where i should have been Then I was so happy that sasha was smarter
      than I was!
